# Polymorph Fabric - Java Implementations
Java implementations of technology ideas from my Polymorph project. This project contains only the
non-GUI implementations. Everything directly related to GUI will be located in another repository.

- Polymorph Data Encoding (PDE) reader and writer implementations
- Polymorph Data Language (PDL) parser implementation


## Polymorph Data Encoding and Polymorph Data Language Specifications
The Polymorph Data Encoding (PDE) and Polymorph Data Language (PDL) specifications can be found in
this GitHub repository:


[PDE and PDL Specifications](https://github.com/jjenkov/pde-pdl-specification)


## Polymorph Data Encoding Writer and Reader

You can see an example of how to write raw, binary PDE in the PdeWriterTest, here:


[PdeWriterTest](https://github.com/jjenkov/polymorph-fabric-java/blob/main/src/test/java/com/plmph/pde/PdeWriterTest.java)


You can see an example of how to read raw, binary PDE in the PdeReaderTest, here:
